# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities by creating an advisory in the repo's security tab.
