## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ever wanted to build something but didn't know where to start? When we have a random project idea, we go ahead and just create a repo here for it. Sometimes they start fun projects, but other times they just get abandonded.

These are our light hearted fun projects, so all contributions are welcome, feel free to open issues and raise PRs!<br>
You're also welcome to submit ideas for new projects by creating a new discussion in the "Ideas" section of the organziational level discussions!
